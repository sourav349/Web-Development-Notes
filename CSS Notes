CSS is a language that is used to describe the style of a document.(text & background colors)(changing documents)
h1{ color : red} where color is a property and red is a value of the property and h1 is the selector'
Inline Style is a type of style in which style is add into the element in the code.
Color property is used for foreground but background-color is used to set color for the background.
Simply adding color style in the normal HTML code with the boilerplate code : 
<h3 style = "color : rgb(8, 5, 86)">Stuti Gupta</h3>
        <p style = "color : pink">I am learning CSS.</p>
        <button style = "color : blue;background-color : pink">Help</button>
but in HTML : Style is added using the style element using the same document.
<title>CSS Chapter 1</title>
        <style>
            h3{
                color : red;
              }
          </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>Stuti Gupta</h3>
        <h3>Female </h3>
        <p>I am learning CSS.</p>
        <button >Help</button>
    </body>
To change the color of h1 very easily as in big companies there are many h1.
External Style Sheet : Writing CSS in a separate document and linking it with HTML file
Linking HTML with CSS file : <head>
                                  <link rel = "stylesheet" href ="style.css">
                              </head>
and then if I write : h1{
                          color : red
                      }
It is applied to all the h1 headings present in the HTML which is very much useful for Programmers to use.
Text related Properties : By default the text alignment is always left
1.Text - align : Left/start,right/end,center,justify             
2.Font - weight : Usually it is from 100 - 900 normal(400),bold(700),100,bolder,lighter
3.Text - decoration : Sets the appearance of decorative lines on text like red/wavy/double/dashed or dotted underline(underline,overline and line-through)
To remove the underline in the anchor tag (by a{ text-decoration : none;} )
4.Line - height : Controls the height of the line of the text.(normal ,2.5 means 2.5 times of normal)
5.Letter - spacing : Controls the horizontal spacing behaviour between text characters.(normal,10px)
6.Font - size : (px,%,em,rem)in which px is the absolute unit in CSS
7.Font - family : Specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names.
font-family : arial
font-family : avant garde,didot,sans-serif; (backup family of fonts)
8.Text-transform : Uppercase (to make all the text uppercase) in CSS.

Universal Selector (*) : *{
                            property : value;
                          }
Element Selector : To select all the elements of the same type. such as h1{ color : red } or h1,h3{color : red; }
Id Selector : Selects an element based on the value of the element's id attribute. #idselector{ color : red; }
Class Selector : Selects an element based on their class attribute. such as .myclass{ property : value; } or .class a { property : value ; } to change in alll the anchor tags in the given class names
Descendant Selector : Selects all paragraphs inside divs such as div p{ property : value; } where div p is a descendant selector to select all the paragraph tags which is under p tag
 nav ul li 
Adjacent Sibling Combinator : p + h3 { property : value;} selecting all the h3 tags which are coming immediately after h3.
Child Combinator : span > button { property : value;} can't go at multiple levels such as descendant selector.
Attribute Selector : Selects elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute. input [attr = "value"] { property : value ;} or input [type] { property : value ; }
If there is a flask infront of any MDN code then it is presently at an experiment phase so don't use it in any of your projects for production at that particular moment.
Pseudo Class : A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
:hover let us suppose if I am going to the button element then it must become black background color and white color as text so to make it we can make a hover by button : hover { background-color : black; color : white; }
:active : it is changed when the particular button is clicked for example : button : active { background-color : hotpink; } if some attributes have defined their unique id or class then the foreground color will be chnaged.
:checked : It is used at the time when one of the radio or checkboxes button is clicked then it may change the appearance of it such as input[type = "radio"] :checked + label{ color : red; font-size : bold; }
:nth-of-type : to change the property of the particular number of part in a particular element : div : nth-of-type(2){ property : value; } write 2n for every even numbered element

Pseudo Element : A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected elements.
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection

What is cascade in CSS?
-The CSS cascade algorithm is a fundamental concept that determines how styles are applied to elements when multiple conflicting rules exist. It ensures that the correct CSS declaration is chosen based on a set of rules.

How the Cascade Works?
When multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, the cascade follows these steps to determine which style wins :

1.Origin & Importance :-
CSS can come from different sources:
  User Agent Stylesheet (Browser Defaults)
  Author Stylesheet (Your CSS Code)
  User Stylesheet (Custom user-defined styles in browsers)
  The priority order is:
      !important rules from the user stylesheet where !@important is used to show the most important thing in the document for example : h3 { color : white !important; } which will definitely be applied every time whether it is 
              declare twice or n times after declaring this.
      !important rules from the author stylesheet (your CSS)
      Normal rules from the author stylesheet
      Normal rules from the user stylesheet
      Browser default styles

2.Specificity :- It is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.
If multiple rules target the same element, the one with the higher specificity wins.
Specificity is calculated based on the type of selector used:
    Inline styles (style="color: red;") → Highest specificity (1,0,0,0)
    ID selectors (#id) → (0,1,0,0)
    Class selectors (.class), attributes ([attr]), and pseudo-classes (:hover) → (0,0,1,0)
    Element selectors (h1, p) and pseudo-elements (::before) → (0,0,0,1) ,descendant selectors

3.Source Order (Last Rule Wins) :-
If two declarations have the same specificity and importance, the last declared rule in the CSS file will be applied.
The cascade is a core CSS concept that resolves conflicts by following a structured order: importance → specificity → source order. Understanding this helps in writing efficient and predictable CSS.

What is Inheritance in CSS?
- Inheritance is a CSS mechanism that allows certain properties to be automatically passed down from a parent element to its child elements. This helps maintain consistency and reduces redundant styling.

How Inheritance Works?
Not all CSS properties are inherited. Inheritance mainly applies to text-related properties, while box-related properties do not inherit by default.
1. Properties That Are Inherited :- The following properties are inherited by default because they are related to text styling :
color,font,visibility,letter-spacing,word-spacing,direction,cursor,line-height

2. Properties That Are Not Inherited :- Other properties (like box model and layout properties) are not inherited by default :
width,height,margin, padding,border,background,display,flex, grid,input,button etc.

3. Forcing Inheritance :- To control inheritance behavior, we can use these values:
inherit → Forces an element to inherit a property from its parent. input { background-color : inherit ; }
initial → Resets the property to its browser default.
unset → Behaves like inherit for inheritable properties and initial for non-inheritable ones.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Box-Model in CSS :-
1.Height : By default it is 100px
2.Width
3.Border
4.Padding : The gap between inner box and outside box.
5.Margin : The distance between 2 individual boxes.
