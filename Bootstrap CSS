                                                      ---Bootstrap CSS---
- Bootstrap is a CSS framework that provides a responsive, mobile-first toolkit for building websites quickly. It includes pre-designed components, flexible grid systems,
and utility classes, making web development faster and easier. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript plugins, custom themes, and extensive documentation for seamless 
integration.
- Vanilla CSS refers to using plain, standard CSS without any frameworks, libraries, or preprocessors like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or SASS. It means writing pure CSS to 
style web pages manually, giving full control over the design but requiring more effort compared to using a CSS framework.
- Bootstrap works with Flexbox because it is built using CSS Flexbox as its core layout system. Bootstrap provides predefined flex utility classes that make it easier 
to use Flexbox without writing custom CSS.
- Bootstrap is a powerful feature-packed frontend toolkit through which we can build anything from prototype to production-in-minutes.
